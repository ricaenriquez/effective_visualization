Summary
**********************
The following charts depict MSP flight status data from the US Department of 
Transportation's Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA - 
http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html). On-time, delayed, and cancelled 
flights conditions can be seen for various time spans. The information can be used to see
good/bad times to fly in/out of MSP. The user has control on filtering by months and years.

Design
**********************
The main plot I wanted to show is the middle chart, which divides the flights by day of 
week and time of day. I thought a stacked and grouped bar chart would best show when the 
best and worst times to fly in/out of MSP are. I also thought it would be nice to see 
percent plots for the given months and years. Additionally, seeing the total number of 
flights in each category for the given data is given.

In addition to the course work template, I used the dimplejs.org advanced examples:

http://dimplejs.org/advanced_examples_viewer.html?id=advanced_interactive_legends

I was also inspired by two projects that was brought to my attention on the forum/google
plus:
